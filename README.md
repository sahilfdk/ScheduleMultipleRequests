# ScheduleMultipleRequests
ScheduleMultipleRequests is a .NET Core console application designed to send scheduled API requests automatically using multiple accounts in parallel. This application waits until a specified time (e.g., 2:00 PM) and then makes asynchronous API calls using different sets of cookies for different accounts.
